I want to take a second to explain what this blog is.

This blog is an open blog.

### What do you mean by an open blog?

Well firstly, like a normal blog it is a place to read articles that I write and occasionaly someone else writes. 

But more than that, this a place that you as a reader, can see the source code, and submit edits regarding any part of my website.

### Like any part??!

Any part. From blog posts to to my server stack and everything in between. 

That means this whole website's source code is in an online public place. 

If you want can take my code, 'fork' it, and setup your own blog.

## The Goal

I hope to demonstrate that by properly utilising a Github repository to host the source code and forum / issue tracking of an open blog you can create can an efficient tool for maintaining open dialogue with users in a public setting.

### What is Github?

Github is the 3rd party where my site's source code is [hosted]((http://github.com/smaxwellstewart/frame)).

If click 'Source Code' in the top menu you will be taken to the project's repository.

If are signed up as a Github user, from the repo you can:

- Reveiw the forum / discuss issues.
- Submit an issue as a way to start a thread of dialogue, or discuss how the site is run. Errors, disagrement with articles, grammatical injustices, whatever it is open an issue...
- Users can submit pull requests to suggest a change any of the site. Community decides is they want the changes.

### Why the hell would i wanna sign up for Gitub account?

 Github is designed as an open source platform. Accounts are:

- Free to sign up
- Gives you free use of it's services for open source projects.

### Rules?
