I want to take a second to explain what this blog is.

This blog is an open blog.

### What do you mean by an open blog?

You as a reader, or contributor, can see, copy and submit edits to any part of my website.

### Like any part??!

Any part. From blog posts to to my server stack and everything in between. 

That means this whole website's source code is in an online public place. 

All my source code.

### But not only that!!!

If you sign up as a Github user you as a reader and contributor to this blog can:

- Reveiw the forum / discuss issues.
- Submit an issue as a way to start a thread of dialogue, or discuss how the site is run. Errors, bugs, grammatical injustices, whatever...
- Developers can contribute code changes to any of the sites functionality. Community decides is they want the changes.

### Why the hell would i wanna sign up for Gitub account?

- It is free to sign up
- Gives you free use of all of it's services for open source projects.

### The good news?

This blog is an open soruce project.

## Goal

I hope to demonstrate that by properly utilising a github account an open blog can more than just a neat way of showing some code, but an efficient developer's tool for maintaining an open dialogue platform in a public setting.
