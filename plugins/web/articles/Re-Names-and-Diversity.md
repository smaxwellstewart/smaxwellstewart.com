A response to an original article, ['Nipples and Poop'](http://hueniverse.com/2014/08/18/nipples-and-poop/).

The main memory I have of shocking nipples growing up, was of their pogniantly blasphemous appearence in The Life of Brian. Despite this film coming out before I born, Monty Python's epic continued to liberate me and many people in England, from the country's oppresive dogma regarding sex, blasphemy and how 'proper' girls and boys should behave.

In the present day and out in cyber-space, there are new 21st century debates to be had on the appropriateness of nipples.

### Open-source high-tech Ren and Stimpy diversity nipples.

Let me take a moment to explain.

'Hapi' is an [open source](http://github.com/hapijs/hapi) tech project I contribute to. Open source means the code is free for anyone to use, there is a public place where it can be downloaded.  This is what open-source means; anyone can use the code, but no one person can own it.

The code is maintained by the community that uses it, and therefore the project's success dependeds on it's community. Hapi is not my job, though I use Hapi in my work, so care about it's success.

The project was started by [Eran Hammer](), who is trying to tackle the big bad [diversity](http://hueniverse.com/2013/07/10/diversity-2/) problem in tech. In the depressing days of #gamergate, this is highly needed. He has taken some really encouraging steps to help encourage diversity in the hapi project.

### So where do nipples come in?

When Hapi was first written, the decsion was made to use Ren and Stimpy references as a naming convention for all the project's various parts.

So 'nipple' and 'poop' were born; two of the many different parts of the Hapi universe. The goal; to add a silly and creative voice in an area where software naming conventions have so far produced Ubuntu's "[Saucy Salamander](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames)", just possibly the worst worst worst release name ever.

### Hapi hapi joi joi?

Mr. Hammer recently [changed his mind](http://hueniverse.com/2014/08/18/nipples-and-poop/) about nipple's appropriateness though, after a language review was conducted of the project:

>The nipple module was initially created as an internal component that no one was meant to use except for those working on hapi core. I know this sounds like an excuse for picking an inappropriate name, and it is, but it was also what was going through my mind – a public private joke. And I’m sorry for that.

He went on,

>What is interesting about the ‘nipple’ experience is that no one brought this issue up. I’ve had very open, frank conversations with women about making a significant shift in diversity within the hapi community and while other topics came up, this didn’t (even though it turned out to be on their mind). But when I asked plainly on Twitter what did people think, the response was strong, quick, and overwhelming.

### Poop is rarely appropriate, but somtimes...

The conslusion was that 'Poop' might make some people feel uncomfortable, but it makes no one **in particular** uncomfortable. 'Nipple' on the other hand seemed to have caused some women **particular** distress.

So following the language review, the module was swiftly re-named to 'Wreck' which sticks to the Ren and Stimpy convention and might I add is an awesome pun.

- It's a module that deals with making requests... wreck-quests... Yes this counts for tech humour.

- This is a module that Eran Hammer is openly admitting got named wrong. In open-source projects it's easier to have open mistakes, ie. wrecks. Sunken regrets and bad decisions that are laid down for everyone to see but are slowly forgotten.

See why this name is awesome.

It works on so many different levels. Two levels!

I will remind you this is tech humor.

### My thoughts

Before I express any kind of opinion, I want to say that I am really encouraged that I am part of a community that is listening to it's members and is taking steps to ensure that it remains an open project for everyone.

At first I disagreed with the name change. I thought that the greater injustice was giving in to the misleading and damging notion that women alone have nipples. And that they are always, and inherently, sexual. The radical part of me still kinda thinks that. If you are gonna break down old fashioned oppressive thinking, you do it Python-style, ridiculous, in drag, bare nipples and all.

But I also spoke with a feminist in Budapest who put it another way:

>If you are a woman in tech, in a room full of men that can barely fathom that you are a woman to start with, do you really want to start talking about nipples?

I can see what she means. A male developer on skype once opined mid-meeting:

>Good software is like a good bitch. It always does what it is supposed to.

With those kind of moronic flipancies being far too common, then perhaps silly Python boy-humor might not save the day.

Maybe we got some way to go before we can make fun of this by wearing a dress?
